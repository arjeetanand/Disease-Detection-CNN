# CNN-based alveolar infection detection

Our project aimed to develop a deep learning-based approach for automated alveoli infection detection using chest X-ray images. We utilized a CNN Sequential Model trained on a suitable dataset, divided into training, testing, and validation sets. Image preprocessing techniques were employed to enhance model accuracy. This diagnostic system is crucial due to the global impact of alveoli infection and the fragility of healthcare services. Implementing our approach can significantly improve the speed and accuracy of diagnosis, leading to better healthcare outcomes. Our work highlights the potential of deep learning in healthcare, particularly in disease diagnosis, and encourages further research in this field.
